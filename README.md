# 📊 Sunvest | Fintech Funnel & Churn Analysis (Excel + Power BI)

**A complete behavioral analytics and conversion optimization project for a fictional fintech brand.**

---

## 🏷️ Project Summary

**Sunvest** is a fictional investment app aiming to simplify investing for young Nigerians aged 20–35. Although the brand attracted thousands of signups through aggressive acquisition campaigns, it faced a major challenge: **users were signing up but not taking action**.

This project simulates a real-world fintech analytics engagement: from raw data to funnel tracking, churn modeling, and strategic recommendations using Excel and Power BI.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Despite growing user signups, Sunvest was experiencing:

- 🚫 Low activation post-signup  
- 💤 Weak early engagement  
- ❌ Minimal wallet funding or transaction activity  
- 📉 High churn within 7–30 days

The business needed to **identify behavioral patterns** and apply data to:
- Diagnose user drop-offs  
- Predict churn  
- Recommend engagement strategies

---

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Build a full user funnel and identify where drop-offs happen  
- Analyze user behavior across segments (gender, state, device, channel)  
- Score users based on churn risk and engagement activity  
- Develop strategic recommendations using data patterns

### ✅ Descriptive Analysis
- Created a full **funnel model**: View App → Sign Up → KYC → Fund Wallet → Make Transaction

### ✅ Diagnostic Analysis

- Flagged dormant users, power users, and partial funnel completers

### ✅ Predictive Analysis
